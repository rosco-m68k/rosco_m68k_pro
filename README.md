# Really Old-School Computer - M68K (Pro Version)
## A Full-featured, Standalone MC68030-based Computer

The rosco_m68k_pro is a full-featured evolution of the rosco_m68k 
project (https://hackaday.io/project/164305-roscom68k), featuring 
a MC68030 CPU, 2MB of on-board RAM, 2MB ROM and (ultimately) FPGA 
video (thanks to Xark's awesome Xosera: 
https://hackaday.io/project/173731-xosera-fpga-based-retro-video-graphics), 
on-board 115K2bps dual UART and SD/IDE storage, and more.

This project is currently WIP, and is at the prototype hardware stage,
with firmware and software development having recently been started.

Stay tuned for more updates! Project logs and other information
